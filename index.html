                    <p class="lead text-muted">Typhoon Kammuri had a sustained maximum wind speed of 215 kilometers per hour (133 miles per hour) and winds of as high as 265 kph (164 mph) when it made an appearance in the Philippines on December 2, 2019. The total amount of precipitation that the Typhoon Kammuri brought differed according to where it hit, but certain regions received over 300 millimeters (11.8 inches) of precipitation in a 24-hour period. Typhoon Kammuri caused heavy rains, landslides, flooding, and storm surges in multiple regions, such as the region of Bicol, Eastern Visayas, as well as Southern Luzon. The typhoon caused significant harm to facilities, residences, and crops, leading to 17 deaths and impacting over 6 million people. customer service.</p>

                    <p class="lead text-muted">Which part of the region that has been greatly affected by the typhoon, geographical location, economic status, population?</h2></p>
                    <p class="lead text-muted">The affected areas include Bicol, Eastern Visayas, and Southern Luzon. The Bicol region is located in the southern portion of Luzon, the Philippines' largest island, whereas Eastern Visayas is an island region in the Philippines' central region. Southern Luzon, on the other hand, is a collection of provinces in the southern part of the island of Luzon. The typhoon had a negative influence on the impacted areas' economies, mainly the farming and tourism industries. Plenty of farmers lost crops, animals, and fishing boats, while the destruction of roads, bridges, and other facilities made transportation and access to markets difficult.</p>

                	<p class="lead text-light">Establishing an Early Warning System: The government of the Philippines  could invest in modern weather monitoring technologies and satellite imaging to offer the people with early warning notifications about an impending typhoon. Furthermore, it can spread information on evacuation and safety precautions via radio, television, and social media.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-light">Evacuation Planning: The government can establish and carry out effective evacuation plans that include pre-identified safe shelters, transportation arrangements, and help for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, pregnant women, and people with disabilities to prevent causes of death during a Typhoon.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-light">Community Resilience: Communities can participate in disaster preparedness, first aid, and basic survival skills training and awareness initiatives. Furthermore, the community can form volunteer networks to help with emergency response and recovery operations after a disaster.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-light">Infrastructure Improvements: To decrease the harm done by the typhoon the government could make the buildings stronger, improve the roads, and put storm-resistant roofs, doors, and windows. Flooding and storm surge effects can be lessened by planting mangroves, trees, and plants.</p>
                    <p class="lead text-light">Emergency Supplies and Aid: The government could prepare emergency supplies including food, water, for the areas that the typhoon is most likely to affect.</p>
